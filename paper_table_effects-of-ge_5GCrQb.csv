Compared to traditional single-event metrics, SOF provides a comprehensive assessment of spatial vulnerabilities and system fragility by accounting for diverse hazard intensities, physical impacts, and outage dynamics, offering deeper insights into outage dynamics and hazard impacts. SOF is applied to power system outages at the county level in Florida for 11 hurricanes from 2017 to 2022, providing valuable insights into the disparities across different utility providers—Investor-Owned, Municipal, and Rural. The analysis reveals that the most fragile counties are Washington, Hardee, Calhoun, and Holmes, while Osceola and Santa Rosa demonstrate the highest resilience. On average, 22% and 76% of counties of All providers reach 50% of the maximum power outages under ERA5 averaged-area wind speeds of 15 to 30 m/s and 30 to 45 m/s, respectively, indicating a potentially significant hurricane vulnerability. The study identifies two high-fragility clusters in the northwest and southern central regions and two high-robustness clusters in the central and southeast regions, with intermediate fragility elsewhere. The potential of SOF for advancing disparity studies is discussed, underscoring the need for multi-event, data-driven approaches to assess energy inequalities in the face of natural hazards.","This study introduces System Outage Fragility (SOF), a data-driven framework analyzing power system disparities across multiple hurricane events, providing a comprehensive assessment of spatial vulnerabilities and system fragility in Florida's power systems from 2017 to 2022."
"Optimizing Distribution Grid Performance through Electric Vehicle Integration and Stochastic Modeling in Extreme Weather Conditions","https://scispace.com/paper/optimizing-distribution-grid-performance-through-electric-3bffh708nz9d","2025","Journal Article","iranica journal of energy and environment","","10.5829/ijee.2025.16.03.15","","This paper presents an innovative method for operational planning of micro grids, focusing on improving economic performance and enhancing resilience. The proposed approach addresses key uncertainties, including weather conditions, probabilistic charging/discharging behavior of electric vehicles (EVs), and integration of renewable energy sources, energy price fluctuations, and load conditions. Additionally, it considers EV owners' satisfaction and demand-side management. A key innovation of this research is the development of a comprehensive framework for simultaneously managing network topology reconfiguration, EV movement within the network, and mitigating the impacts of adverse weather conditions. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to model uncertainties, while a multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to solve the problem. This algorithm aims to maximize the profits of network operators and the private sector while minimizing unsupplied energy and its associated penalties. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements, including a 37.1% reduction in unsupplied energy costs, a 5% increase in network operators' profits, and a 23.1% boost in EV charging station profits. Overall, the method outperforms existing approaches by approximately 8%. The proposed method offers an effective and robust solution for improving micro grid resilience and operational efficiency under extreme weather conditions, showcasing its superiority over traditional approaches.

We studied analogous solar events, where several CMEs were launched partly from the same (active) regions near a CH. These events occurred in two episodes, separated by a full solar rotation, covering October 31-November 3 and November 27-28, 2023. Both episodes are linked to strong geomagnetic storms on November 4-5 and December 1-2, 2023. We aim to understand the complexity of these events and how the global magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and structural interactions relate to the observed geomagnetic effects. Using the GCS 3D reconstruction method, we derived each CME's motion direction and speed. These results were input into the DBM with enhanced latitudinal information (3D DBM), aiding in connecting in-situ measurements with solar surface structures for integrated interpretation. The first episode caused SAR arcs, with a three-step Dst index drop to -163 nT on November 5, 2023. Two CME-related shocks arrived close in time, separated by a SBC, followed by a short-duration flux rope-like structure. The second episode saw auroral lights and a two-step Dst index drop to -108 nT on December 1, 2023. A shock from one CME interacted with the magnetic structure of a preceding CME, again combined with an SBC. A clear flux rope structure from the shock-producing CME was detected. Both events showed distinct magnetic field 'ripples' and fluctuations in density and temperature following the SBC. This study compares two episodes of multiple eruptive events in November and December 2023. Interacting CME structures and SBC-related magnetic modulations contributed to the stronger geomagnetic impacts, particularly in the November 4-5, 2023 event. The highly tilted heliospheric current sheet may have further influenced the CMEs' impact at Earth.

This paper studies the dependability and impact of soft errors on BERT implemented with different floating-point formats using two case studies: sentence emotion classification and question & answering. Simulation by error injection is conducted to assess the impact of errors on different parts of the BERT model and different bits of the parameters. The analysis of the results leads to the following findings: 1) in both single and half precision, there is a Critical Bit (CB) on which errors significantly affect the performance of the model; 2) in single precision, errors on the CB may cause overflow in many cases, which leads to a fixed result regardless of the input; 3) in half precision, the errors do not cause overflow but they may still introduce a large accuracy loss. In general, the impact of errors is significantly larger in single-precision than half-precision parameters. Error propagation analysis is also considered to further study the effects of errors on different types of parameters and reveal the mitigation effects of the activation function and the intrinsic redundancy of BERT.","This study assesses the dependability of BERT to soft errors using simulation and error injection, finding significant impact on single-precision parameters, with critical bit errors causing overflow and accuracy loss, particularly in sentence emotion classification and question-answering tasks."

However, unplanned events such as trips or voltage fluctuations often result in beam outages, causing operational downtime. This downtime not only consumes operator effort in diagnosing and addressing the issue but also leads to unnecessary energy consumption by idle machines awaiting beam restoration. The current threshold-based alarm system is reactive and faces challenges including frequent false alarms and inconsistent outage-cause labeling. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages predictive analytics and automated labeling. Using data from $2,703$ Linac devices and $80$ operator-labeled outages, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including recurrent, attention-based, and linear models, for beam outage prediction. Additionally, we assess a Random Forest-based labeling system for providing consistent, confidence-scored outage annotations. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures for beam outage prediction and identify critical gaps that must be addressed to fully harness AI for transitioning downtime handling from reactive to predictive, ultimately reducing downtime and improving decision-making in accelerator management.

Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly embedded in infrastructure and economic systems and their resiliency is essential for social and economic stability. This has led to widespread dystopic fears and defensive regulations, ignoring the considerable positives of AI-enhanced activities and institutions. AI resiliency problems include hardware failures, natural calamities, human error, software defects, and external attacks. AI networks of AI networks have emerged with high interdependence and complexity. Operations are often non-transparent ‘black boxes’ operating at lightning speeds, and hard to oversee or fix by humans. Most likely is a control of AI by other AI. This raises the question of human responsibility. The article examines various responses, including technology tools, managerial actions, self-regulation, and a role for government. The latter include rules evolving with technology and applications in a dynamic common law approach for liability, transparency, performance, market structure, interoperation, and more. Needed are principles for a ‘shared intelligence’ of humans with AI, with clear protocols for human overrides of AI. All this raises a new agenda for policymakers, managers, and researchers.","As AI is increasingly embedded in critical infrastructure, its resiliency is crucial for social and economic stability, but its complexity and opacity raise concerns about human responsibility, control, and liability, necessitating a new agenda for policymakers and researchers."

Jing Zhang","10.1186/s42162-024-00465-6","","This study aims to enhance the intelligence level of power grid fault analysis to address increasingly complex fault scenarios and ensure grid stability and security. To this end, an intelligent information system for power grid fault analysis, leveraging improved computer communication technology, is proposed and developed. The system incorporates a novel fault diagnosis model, combining advanced communication technologies such as distributed computing, real-time data transmission, cloud computing, and big data analytics, to establish a multi-layered information processing architecture for grid fault analysis. Specifically, this study introduces a fusion model integrating Transformer self-attention mechanisms with graph neural networks (GNNs) based on conventional fault diagnosis techniques. GNNs capture the complex relationships between different nodes within the grid topology, effectively identifying power transmission characteristics and fault propagation paths across grid nodes. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism processes time-series operational data from the grid, enabling precise identification of temporal dependencies in fault characteristics. To improve system response speed, edge computing moves portions of fault data preprocessing and analysis to edge nodes near data sources, significantly reducing transmission latency and enhancing real-time diagnosis capability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance across various fault types (e.g., short circuits, overloads, equipment failures) in simulation scenarios. The system achieves a fault identification and location accuracy of 99.2%, an improvement of over 10% compared to traditional methods, with an average response time of 85 milliseconds, approximately 43% faster than existing technologies. Moreover, the system exhibits strong robustness in complex scenarios, with an average fault prediction error rate of just 1.1% across multiple simulations. This study provides a novel solution for intelligent power grid fault diagnosis and management, establishing a technological foundation for smart grid operations.

It consists of several stages and activities designed to reduce susceptibility, boost resilience, and enable effective response and recovery operations. Managing disasters entails allocating resources and dividing up work to reduce risk and damage. This essay examines the difficulties that organizations encounter and how disasters affect business. It is also aware of how machine learning is applied to disaster relief efforts during natural disasters. The study's objective is to determine whether companies are equipped to handle emergencies. After that, it creates maps and alerts that are shared with communities and local authorities, providing them with vital time to prepare and respond. Reaction to Disasters As natural disasters occur more frequently, prompt and effective responses are crucial. By processing vast volumes of data rapidly and correctly, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming these answers from a traditionally reactive procedure to a proactive, data-driven approach. IBM's PAIRS Gyroscope, a unique cloud-based geospatial analytics tool, serves as the best example of this. AI is employed in satellite picture processing and disaster damage assessment. Utilizing this current information, disaster response teams may plan and prioritize locations that need immediate attention, which boosts their efficacy and efficiency significantly.
