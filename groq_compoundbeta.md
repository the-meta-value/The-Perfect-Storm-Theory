Another reason that injuries, deaths and property damage occur weeks, months or years after a recall: When refunds are difficult for consumers to get, dangerous products may remain in people’s homes, with the potential for more calamities. That’s not counting the injuries and at least 10 additional deaths linked to products that companies _didn’t_ recall, despite the CPSC’s requests.",

There were 529 murders reported in the RTCI sample of 340ish cities in January 2025 compared to 620 in January 2024. That 91 fewer murders in January 2025 produces a large percent change. If the difference in December 2025 is still 91 murders then the percent change will be much smaller because the denominator will be much larger. [...] The decline reported in the RTCI sample matches the eye test as big cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St Louis, New Orleans/), Denver, and Los Angeles are all reporting large declines in nearly every category of crime so far in 2025.\n\nThat said, there are several reasons why it’s probably a bit too early to draw any definitive conclusions about where crime is headed nationally in 2025.",
