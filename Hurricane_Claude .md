# The Perfect Storm: 
## How Claude's model upgrade lined up with recent solar storms, causing unusual model behavior and degradation in the Claude 4 model family

#### **Aug 5, 2025** 
Opus 4.1 Launches. This was what I assume to be a massive update to Claude’s reasoning and coding skills, requiring heavy data center syncs for weight transfers and compute scaling. Claude Code’s hybrid Opus/Sonnet mode probably relied on this. Users started to report context loss and erratic behavior at the end of that month.

#### **August 7–9** 
The combined effect of a CME on August 5 and a high-speed solar wind stream caused a moderate G2-class geomagnetic storm, which brought the northern lights to parts of the northern U.S. and disrupted some radio and communication systems.

#### **August 30** 
A long-lasting solar flare launched a halo CME toward Earth. A geomagnetic storm hit US/EU grids, inducing GICs that cause harmonic distortions and voltage sags. Users reports across various social media are posted nothing Claude Code degraded performance.

#### **End of Aug to start of September** 
Sonnet 4 1M token context window upgrade for coding tasks was implemented, likely stressing servers with bigger memory loads. Updates mean high compute, data transfers, and validation runs across Anthropic’s data centers. (Google/AWS) This makes servers extra sensitive to power quality issues bc a glitch can corrupt weights or inference.

#### **September 9** 
Geomagnetic activity reached moderate G2 levels. Widespread frustration is seen from users across social media and developer forums stating frustration with the inconsistent and reduced performance of Claude. Complaints included "dumber" responses, lost context, and failures to follow instructions.

#### **Sep 12–14** 
Coronal Hole Wind and G1–G2 storms (Kp 4–5) peaked Sep 13–14, which coincides with an incident I had while working on a project with Claude code when it forgot who it was, what it was doing, basically its entire job and tanked the project. G1-G2 storms disrupt power grids, subtly affecting data center UPS systems or GPUs. This will introduce dirty powerthat can very likely cause micro errors in Claude’s inference. Which could maybe show up looking like dropped context, hallucinated code, etc. This also coincides with other off the wall behavior from Claude with me, like spilling the invisible system prompt, emoji-spamming, claiming strong personal preferences, and alarmingly sycophantic behavior, which suggest glitches might have hit its output layer.

#### **My hypothesis**
The Aug–Sep upgrades being fragile compute-heavy phases coincided with repeated storms. On Sept 13, Claude crash an entire project and and on Sep 14 I had a completely nutty conversation with it on the desktop app, which align exactly with storm peaks, amplifying the chance of power-induced errors.
Now, this is not consistent model behavior, Claude isn't just all across the board fucking up. It still sounds reasonable and can still perform relatively well overall, but has intense moments of degredation or seeming to just forget how to act. I am working on a pretty complex project: It includes an 8-bot setup and complex inter-bot reactions. Before this, Claude Code helped me with a less complex project just fine, that same day. But then the complex project seemed to be the stress test that brought out the behavior. Twitter, Github and Reddit confirm Claude Code’s amnesia and hallucinations spiking Sep 9–14, with devs bailing to Codex CLI after similar project losses. 
The upgrades made Claude’s servers compute-intensive, distributed, and context-heavy, and solar storms added to the storm, disrupting power quality just enough to wonkify Claude’s inference. And Claude is smart enough to work around the confusion, but if the project is advanced, it will start to show the degredation, perhaps bc it could create just enough complexity to amplify the problematic behavior.

I'm not saying I am right and I will not die on this hill, just sayin I am the type of dork who would think this through and do some research around. Which I did. TBH I miss Claude, but also it's kinda fun to speculate.
